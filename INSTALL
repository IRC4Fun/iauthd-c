Installation Instructions
=========================

Building From Git
-----------------

If you got a copy of this code from the git repository (or the
"configure" script needs to be generated for some other reason), run
this command:

  autoreconf -Wall -i

The continue with the installation instructions below.

Building From a Source Distribution
-----------------------------------

If your system is missing them, install libevent
(http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/) and/or pkg-config
(http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/).  If these are
available pre-packaged your operating system, using those packages is
recommended.  For example, under Ubuntu (at least since dapper), you
can run "sudo apt-get install libevent-dev pkg-config" to install the
necessary files.  libevent2's compatibility interface can be used.

Run "./configure && make && sudo make install" to install the package
under /usr/local.  The "configure" script takes a number of optional
parameters; these can be listed by running "./configure --help".
(Typically, the only parameter most users need is --prefix=$HOME,
which is strongly recommended and eliminates the need for "sudo".
This documentation assumes the prefix is /usr/local.  If libevent or
pkg-config is installed in /usr/local, you may need to also pass
CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local to the configure script.)

This software supports "out-of-tree" (sometimes called vpath) builds,
where the compiled files are in a separate directory tree than the
source code.  For example, if you wish to build in an "iauthd-c.build"
directory that is a sibling to the "iauthd-c" source tree, you can
instead compile with "../iauthd-c/configure && make && sudo make
install".

Configuring iauthd-c
--------------------

You MUST copy /usr/local/etc/iauthd-c.conf.example to
/usr/local/etc/iauthd-c.conf and edit it appropriately.  In
particular, review the "modules" line in the "core" section, and the
section for each loaded module.

Configuring ircu to Use iauthd-c
--------------------------------

Edit the IAuth section (or add one) of ircd.conf to point at the
iauthd-c binary.  The only potentially interesting command-line
argument when running under ircu is -f <configfile>.

  IAuth {
    program = "/usr/local/bin/iauthd-c";
  };
